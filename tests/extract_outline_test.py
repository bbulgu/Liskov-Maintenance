introduction = """Introduction 
Prices for academic journals, particularly science journals, have been on the rise 
for decades.1 For researchers without access to an institutional library, these 
cost increases have come to mean paying $30 or more for each journal article 
they need to read. When they need to read hundreds of papers, these costs 
quickly become unmanageable. In 2011, a researcher in Kazakhstan created a 
website call Sci-Hub that allows anyone to access the full text of millions of 
scientific articles for free. Librarians should be aware of Sci-Hub because many 
of their patrons are already using it, and it will undoubtedly affect their expec-
tations about what their library should provide and how quickly they should be 
able to get articles. Librarians should also understand the risks that Sci-Hub can 
pose to their patrons, their institutions, and themselves.
